# 🛒 Shop List App

A simple and elegant shopping list application built with **React**.  
This project is inspired by Jonas Schmedtmann's course, but the code and structure are fully implemented in **my own way** with custom features and styling.

## ✨ Features

- Add new products with name, quantity, and category
- Category emojis like 🥦, 🍪, 🧽 to visually group items
- Edit existing products ✏️
- Mark items as bought ✅ or to-buy
- Filter products:
  - All
  - Bought
  - To Buy
- Real-time search 🔍
- Clear all products 🧹
- Smooth UX with form toggling
- **Responsive design** (mobile & desktop)
- Modern, minimalistic dark theme using CSS variables
