# 🛒 Shop List

A simple and interactive shopping list built with **React.js**.  
Users can add products, check them as bought, edit or remove them, and view real-time statistics.  
The app supports emoji-based categories and clean, responsive design with custom CSS variables.

> ⚒️ This project is based on my own learning experience, inspired by the [Jonas Schmedtmann's React course](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-ultimate-react-course/), and written entirely in my own way.
